# Status Item Tester

See [this blog post](http://www.shipsomecode.com/software/a-tool-for-designing-better-os-x-status-items/) for a full explanation and a demo.

You can download an already compiled version of the app from [here.](http://www.shipsomecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/StatusItemTester-1.0.zip)
It is compatible with OS X 10.6 & 10.7

Developed by [John Winter](http://shipsomecode.com) (john@aptonic.com)

## Usage

Clone this repository, build the project with Xcode 4 and then drag an image file onto the window. 

When a change to the file is detected the status item will be automatically updated. 

This enables you to edit a status item image with an editor such as Pixelmator
and then when you save you can immediately see the change reflected in the status item.
