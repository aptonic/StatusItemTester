## Usage

To use Status Item Tester clone this repository, compile with Xcode 4 and then drag an image file onto the window. 

When a change to the file is detected
the status item will be automatically updated. 

This enables you to edit a status item image with an editor such as Pixelmator
and then when you save you can immediately see the change reflected in the status item.
